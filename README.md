# Satellite Look Angle Calculator - React Project

Satellite Look Angle Calculator is a React-based project that provides a form to calculate the Look Angle (azimuth and elevation) for a satellite from a specified observer's location on Earth. It offers a user-friendly interface for users to input the necessary parameters and obtain the Look Angle data for their desired satellite.

## Features

- Calculates the Look Angle (azimuth and elevation) for a satellite based on the observer's location.
- Interactive form that allows users to input the necessary parameters, such as satellite TLE (Two-Line Elements), observer's latitude, longitude, and altitude.
- Provides real-time calculations and displays the Look Angle results to users.
- Clean and organized codebase with modular components for easy maintenance.
- Utilizes popular React libraries to enhance the user experience.
